          <div id="c1">Vegetable fried rice is a favorite Indo-chinese fusion food to the Indian palate. It has several variations to it. The simplest version is to first saute onions, ginger and garlic paste along with sliced green chillies. Once the onions are carmelised and the raw smell of garlic has gone, we can add the sliced vegetables of choice like bell peppers, mushrooms, peas being mine. Once they are stir fried a bit with salt to taste, we can add the rice to the pan and saute that a bit too. After it is coated with oil, pour water in the ratio of 1:2 for the rice and close the pan till the rice gets cooked.
